# What is theLittleGuy ?

The little guy is a kind of a big project which will have a lot of functionalities in  the future. However, right now it has only the first module (dictionary attacking the webserver to get the available paths).

# Features :

1- Multi threading.

2- Error detection (it can detect if there is something wrong for example if the webserver have blocked you).

3- Pause and continue later (when you press CTRL+C the script will create a new list which contains the untested words in the list in case you wanted to continue later!).

4- Connecting to an HTTP proxy.

5- Changing the user-agent.

6- Verbose mode.

7- Creating a file at the end of execution which contains the results.

# Pre-requirements :

1- python3.

2- requests library (I think it is shipped with the latest versions of python but I added it just in case).
